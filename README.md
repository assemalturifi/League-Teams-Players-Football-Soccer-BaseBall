# League-Teams-Players-Football-Soccer-BaseBall

Created an abstract class called Player which Soccer,Football and Baseball classes extends from.
Created a Team class that you can add specific Players to a specific Team, because 
parameterized types and bounded types are used.
Moreover, there is a League class that extends the Team class
And the team class also calculates the match results and gives us the ranking.
